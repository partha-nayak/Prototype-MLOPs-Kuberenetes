## Description 

MLOps is an emerging field that aims to bring repeatability, automation, and standardization of the software engineering domain to data science and machine learning engineering. By implementing MLOps with Kubernetes, data scientists, IT professionals, and data engineers can collaborate and build machine learning solutions that deliver business value for their organization.

This is the source code for building and using a complete open source machine learning platform on Kubernetes


## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
docker tag scikit-notebook:v1.1.0 quay.io/ml-on-k8s/scikitnotebook:v1.1.0
```

### Software and Hardware List


| Software required                    | OS required                        |
| ------------------------------------ | -----------------------------------|
| kubernetes, Python, Spark, MLflow,   | WLinux (Any) |
| Seldon, Airflow                      |                                    |

Running the platform requires a good amount of compute resources. If you do not have
the required number of CPU cores and memory on your desktop or laptop computer, we
recommend running a virtual machine on Google Cloud or any other cloud platform
